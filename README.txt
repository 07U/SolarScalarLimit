This is the python code for the results in https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.095021 (a free arXiv version can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02568 or in https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1909.02568).
We tried to refer to all of the relevant sources in the paper itself and in the code. If we forgot someone, please don't hesitate to contact me!

The file "Bounds on Light Scalars from LUX and XENON1T.ipynb" is given with the results of the run in it, so one can just take a look without running anything. For the case where some modiications are wanted, the data files used to produce the results are given.

If you use this code, please let me know, and give a proper credit :)
